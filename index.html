<h2 style="text-align:center;">

  <p> Dubious Data Dildo is an internet design project based on Aram Bartholl’s ‘DeadDrops’ project. On the outside, both projects seem similar to each other, being essentially USB's stuck to a wall, but the main difference is their reason for being there in the first place. </p>

	  	 <h3 style="text-align:center;">
  <p> While DeadDrops focuses on anonymous information sharing, Dubious Data Dildo explores what is arguably the biggest danger of taking part in such a project: Infection. There is no way of knowing what is contained within the USBs stuck in the wall, unless you stick it into your laptop or device. This makes it easy for malicious individuals to leave behind computer viruses or malware within these public USB's, and whoever tries to extract data from it will be infected. </p>

<p> Using STDs as a metaphor, I made this project not only to make people aware of the dangers of anonymous data sharing, but also the dangers of unprotected intercourse with strangers. Both dangers are vastly different from one another, yet are conceptually similar, making it easier to merge the two different ideas together. </p>

<p> This is why I chose the penis (or in this case a dildo) for my project, as a USB left out in the open is about as safe as a penis with an STD; It may look clean, but once you stick it into the metaphorical hole, you are infected, with no way of knowing about it until the harmful effects emerge, which by then it will be too late as the damage is done. I also chose the form of a penis because in terms of imagery and a metaphor, it is essentially a penetrative object that goes into a hole, and has the possibility of spreading a virus. </p>

<p> A virus is defined as an infectious agent that is transferred via some form of contact, infecting other hosts and causing detrimental effects to it. While viruses have plagued humans since the dawn of time, the term virus has also spread to computers, being used as an umbrella term for whenever a computer comes into contact with code or software that damages it. This is because computer viruses are similar to biological viruses, in that thay can self duplicate, and cause detrimental effects to their host. Even their method of infection and propagation is similar; for a biological organism, should it come into contact with an infeted host, be it through skin contact, sharing of bodily fluids, etc, the healthy host gets infected, and this can happen without either person knowing about the virus in the first place until it takes effect. For computers and digital devices, should they come into contact with a digital virus, be it through a USB plug infected with the virus or downloading an infected piece of software, they too become infected, and most users won't know about it until it's too late. </p>

<p> My design piece is a physical object, which consists of a Dildo being modified to store a USB inside it, with the 'head' of the dildo acting as a cover which people can take off to expose the USB head. It will the be stuck to a wall, preferably in an alleyway or someplace without children, evoking the look of a gloryhole. </p>

<p> In terms of intended audiences, I am not aiming at any particular group. In fact, a project like this is bound to attract all kinds of people, considering it's outwards appearance is that of a male sexual organ, and the fact that it is exposed out in the open for all to see will stir up attention. The younger generation will most likely share it through social media, while older generations are more likely to spread it by word of mouth or more traditional forms of media such as the newspaper. </p>
